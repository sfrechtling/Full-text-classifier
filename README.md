# Full-text-classifier
Python based full text classifier with multiple algorithms. 

GFTCT is designed to make classification of public company announcements, but in principle can be used for other classification tasks. Announcements are represented as sets of words from announcement text without taking into account their order in text.
So the hypothesis is that we can make a trading decision about corresponding company stocks (wether to buy stocks or stock-options or sell them) based on such representation of announcements and these decisions will give us positive mean profit.
